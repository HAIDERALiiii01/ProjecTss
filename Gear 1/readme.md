A short description:
    ("So these are all the projects I have made during my Python basics learning journey, through courses but with the touch of my fingers, tried my best to make them unique and fun using my imagination. I know these projects are just simple and basic but 'As long you are alive, there will be better things later, and there will be many.'")
